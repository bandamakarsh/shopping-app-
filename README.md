## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Creational Design Patterns** in different web application case studies using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The patterns implemented are:

1. **Singleton**
2. **Factory Method**
3. **Abstract Factory**
4. **Builder**
5. **Prototype**

The goal is to showcase how these patterns can be applied to solve real-world problems in web applications with good UI/UX design.

## ðŸ“Œ Case Studies
### 1. Banking App â€“ LoanFactory (Abstract Factory)
- **Factory:** `LoanFactory`
- **Products:** `HomeLoan`, `CarLoan`, `EducationLoan`
- **Description:** Creates different types of loans with details like amount, interest rate, and tenure.

### 2. E-commerce App â€“ ShippingFactory (Abstract Factory)
- **Factory:** `ShippingFactory`
- **Products:** `StandardShipping`, `ExpressShipping`, `InternationalShipping`
- **Description:** Provides shipping methods with different costs and delivery times.

### 3. Ride-Hailing App â€“ VehicleFactory (Abstract Factory)
- **Factory:** `VehicleFactory`
- **Products:** `Bike`, `Auto`, `Car`
- **Description:** Creates vehicles with associated `DriverProfile`.

## ðŸ“Œ Implemented Patterns
- **Singleton:** Used for Cart / Session management (only one instance exists).
- **Factory Method:** Used for generating products (food items, loans, vehicles, etc.).
- **Abstract Factory:** Used for creating families of related objects (Payments, Shipping, Vehicles, Loans).
- **Builder:** Used for step-by-step construction (e.g., Pizza Builder / Custom Order).
- **Prototype:** Used for cloning objects (e.g., duplicating an order).
